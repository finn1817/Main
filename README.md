## **Welcome to my Main Website!**
üõ† **The way this is set up...**
- Starts from a repository reading from a single index script. The main index points out to every other folder containing an index.html which has a page of its own for each column.
## How everything works

* Everything besides the main dashboard is now broken up into its own folder, seperating everything and making it much easier to work on if needed. This keeps all layouts consitent, allows me to move from page to page while keeping my light / dark mode feature working, and lets me keep the entire project in one place, rather than split around 10 - 15 different repositories!

# **Websites Background**

- I currently have every site up and running on through Github, connecting to my domain, **https://www.dfinn.me**

- The idea was to make a clean layout combining all my individual websites repositories into one solid big repository.

- This does have a more modern design system in place for the light & dark mode, as it uses built in image links to the light and dark images and has a smooth transition from one mode to the other.

- This does use multi page navigation, where each section is a full page instead of aloowing scrolling on every single one.

- This does still seperate all other projects besides my main website, meaning they won't be moved into this repository.

- Almost every page has a link back to the main page on the top bar!

- Basically anything! It makes a good portfolio website, but it can also just make a nice dashboard linking tons of other sites!
